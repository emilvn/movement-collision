/**
 * Implements the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the optimal path between two points on a game board.
 * The algorithm navigates through a tile-based grid where each tile type has specific properties:
 * - Traversable tiles (grass, floor, path) have weight = 1
 * - Obstacles (walls, water, cliffs) have weight = Infinity
 * - Movement is restricted to orthogonal directions (no diagonals)
 *
 * The algorithm works by minimizing f(n) = g(n) + h(n) where:
 * - g(n): Actual cost from start to node n (sum of tile weights)
 * - h(n): Manhattan distance to goal (optimal heuristic for grid with only orthogonal movement)
 * - f(n): Total estimated path cost through node n
 *
 * Data Structures:
 * - PriorityQueue: MinHeap-based queue that maintains nodes ordered by fScore
 *   * Each node contains grid coordinates and priority (fScore)
 *   * Ensures we always process the most promising path first
 *   * Provides O(log n) insertion and extraction
 * - openSetCoords: Set of coordinates we've seen but not yet processed
 * - gScore/fScore: Maps using coordinate keys to track path costs
 * - cameFrom: Map to reconstruct the optimal path
 *
 * Process:
 * 1. Convert start/goal from pixel coordinates to grid coordinates
 * 2. Initialize start node:
 *    - gScore = 0
 *    - fScore = manhattan distance to goal
 *    - Add to priority queue with fScore as priority
 * 3. While priority queue not empty:
 *    - Dequeue node with lowest fScore
 *    - If goal reached, reconstruct and return path
 *    - For each neighbor:
 *      * Calculate new gScore through current node
 *      * If new path is better:
 *        - Update gScore and fScore
 *        - Enqueue with new fScore as priority
 *
 * @param {{x: number, y: number}} start Starting pixel position
